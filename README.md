# Ideal-Gas-Simulation
Created a simulation of ideal gas particles that were modelled by Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution

Below is a example and the output of my code:

In this code, I'm running two simulations of particles with different radii and masses to see their effects on the 
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is calculated using the average kinetic energy that is within the particle system.
